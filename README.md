# LAB - 11

## Odd-Duck

I created a web page for the Odd Duck Product Co that will survey employees of the company, asking them to help select the next product going to market.  The functionality includes:  display of three product images that rotate after an image is selected, rotation will end after 25 times, the number of clicks will be collected/stored and results displayed on the page.  The rotating image functionality has been completed.  Report functionality is still to come.

New report functionality added.  Once 25 items have been selected, user will click the "View Results" button to display a bar graph displaying the results.  Additional styling was added to the images, results button, text, chart.

Local storage functionality was added to browser to store and load continued votes and views once browser has been refreshed or reset.

### Reflections and Comments

* I'm missing some of the lab functionality, such as getting the report to print.  I ran out of time to tackle that requirement today.  I was able to get part of the grid CSS to work but having issues with one section/column (Report/Results) column.  Also my View Results button needs to be hidden when making selections.
* I primarily used the class demo for this lab along with ChatGPT and the grid layout tool website.
* Report functionality added in lab 12 along with additional styling. Accessibility score remains the same at 100.
* Local Storage functionality added in lab13.  Used ChatGPT to get me started.  It got be 75% of the way and then enlisted help from TA to get functionality to work. Lighthouse score still the same.
